Data is processed - cleaned, checked for nulls and consistent data types. Categorical attributes are encoded and features scaled for ML model implementation.
## Results
The highest accuracy of Prediction was **95.7%** given by **Random Forest Cassifer** followed by **94.3%** & **91.4%** for **SVM** and **KNN classifiers** respectively.
## Customer Attrition KPI
As part of this project, a KPI dashboard using Power BI has been developed to visualize factors influenceing Cutomer attrition, and extract useful insights and trends.
